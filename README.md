### About The Project

It is a weekend project.

I developed this project to make practice with **Nodejs** and **socket.io**. Client side is written with **Reactjs**. Both the server side and the frontend are included in this repo.

Server side is kept in  <a href="https://www.heroku.com">**Heroku**</a> and client side in <a href="https://www.netlify.com">**Netlify**</a>
